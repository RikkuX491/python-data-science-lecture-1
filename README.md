# Intro to Python Data Structures, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas

## Introduction

In this lecture, you will learn about Python data structures including lists and dictionaries, and the following Python libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.

## Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

- Utilize Python data structures including lists and dictionaries to manage large amounts of data
- Utilize Numpy methods to calculate measures of central tendency including mean, median, and mode
- Use Matplotlib to perform data visualization by:
  - Creating a bar graph
  - Creating a scatter plot
  - Create a histogram
- Aggregate data by groups using pandas DataFrames

## Setup

To get started, run the following command in your terminal to start the Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

We'll use the Jupyter Notebook during today's lecture.
